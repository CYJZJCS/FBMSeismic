# FBM_Seismic
Fibre bundle model for Co-seismic landslide simulation

This script can be used with the LISEM model (www.lisemmodel.com) to simulate co-seismic slope stabiltiy and fractional damages in slopeing soils.
It implements the Fibre Bundle Method (FBM), and links with hydrolgical and seismic forces, and a Mohr Coulomb soil strength model.
